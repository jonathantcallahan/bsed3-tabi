\f0\fs36 \cf0 ANIMAL WELFARE\
Pigs are smarter than dogs/ 3 year old humans, can recognize themselves in a mirror, have likes and dislikes, form strong bonds with their young and sing to them while nursing, and are deeply social and emotional animals. Cows have best friends, long memories, and can keep grudges. They can understand cause and effect, and get excited after solving a problem. Chickens posess self control and can identify their own position in social order (both indicitive of self-awareness), have complex communication, and demonstrate empathy.\

Recommended watching: <a href='{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.nationearth.com/"}}{\fldrslt http://www.nationearth.com/}}' target='_blank'>Earthlings</a>. Put simply, the treatment of animals in factory farms is incomprehensibly cruel. If you are interested in the details they can be <a href='{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "http://www.lcanimal.org/index.php/campaigns/other-issues/factory-farming"}}{\fldrslt http://www.lcanimal.org/index.php/campaigns/other-issues/factory-farming}}' target='_blank'>found easily online</a> but I will avoid them here to spare younger readers. Animals in factory farms spend most of their life in semi-darkness, unable to move in cages the size of their bodies, are forcibly impregenated and have their young taken from them, and are then slaughtered in horriffc ways often without being stunned. Confined to a body size cage unable to engage in their natural behavior, these intelligent and emotionally complex animals usually go insane spending all day crying and screaming. \

WORLD HUNGER \
Diminished return\
For every 100 calories that an animal eats, only 12 make it to humans as meat. This means that in order to produce any amount of meat there needs to be a hugely disporportionate amount of crops grown to feed to those animals. Which combined with other factors of animal production has a cascading impact on the global availability of food which we'll discuss here.\

Stocks fed to livestock\
36% of all crops grown go to feed animals. In fact raising animals for food, including land for grazing and growing feed crops, currently uses over one-third of the earths land mass. Researchers determined that if this land was used instead for a nutritionally equivalent combination of edible plants the total food available in the world would increase by 120%. Even just taking the crops that are being grown for livestock now and feeding them to people instead would be more than enough to entirely end world hunger.  \

Population growth\
Currently 850 million people around the world are suffering from hunger and every year starvation kills 2.5 million children under the age of five. Even still, the global population is projected to grow by over 2 billion in the next 30 years. Sustainability and ethics aside, due to the diminishing caloric return of animal products it will be physically impossible to sustain the world population on a meat based diet. The U.N.'s plan to end world hunger by 2030 is based on drastically reducting the amount of meat in diets worldwide.\

Global Warming\
Livestock and their byproducts account for approximately 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, and those emissions are expected to increase by 80% by 2050. If we stopped all fossil fuel use 
\f1\b today
\f0\b0 , we would still exceed our atmospheric greenhouse gas maximum of 32 gigatons 
\f1\b in the next 12 years 
\f0\b0 from livestock emissions alone. Animal agriculture is responsible for 80% of the worlds total deforestation which compounds the damage of the emissions. \

Global Ecosystems\
We are currently in the middle of the largest mass extinction in 65 million years. 1/3 of all landmass is used for animal agriculture, and 1/3 is desertified with animal agriculture as the driving force. Animal agriculture is responsible for 91% of the deforestation of the Amazon for grazing animals and growing feed, with 1-2 acres being lost every second. Other industries (logging, crops, etc.) certainly play a role, however animal agriculture is destroying ecosystems at a rate that dwarfs all of these other industries combined.\

Ocean Health\
Around 2.7 trillion animals are pulled out of the ocean every year. For every 1 pound of fish that are caught, 5 pounds of unintented marine species are discarded as by-kill. 3/4 of the wolrds oceans are already depleted and we could see fishless oceans by as early as 2048. As many as 650 thousand, and 40 - 50 million sharks are killed by fishing vessels every year. 46% of the plastic in the ocean is from commercial fishing. Landstock operations on land have created more than 500 nitrogen flooded deadzones in around the ocean.\

looking both at cost per calorie on macro equivalent diets and self reported food spending. Vegan diet is less expensive\
Vegan or not, prepared food is more expensive than unprocessed food. To make sure the playing field is level we will be looking at unprocessed vegan vs non-vegan diets. There are also peripheral costs to take into account which we will be looking at as well.\
Bottom line: Looking at both calorie-to-calorie macro equivalent diet calculations and food spending survey data, a vegan diet costs (a lot) less than a non-vegan diet.\

On average, total food spending for meat eaters is 29% higher than for vegans. If your household spends about $150 on food a week, that\'92s over $2,000 of savings per year\

medical expenses\
extrapolating from health stats of vegans vs non vegans\
cancer, heart disease stats, diabetes\
we say with a high level of confidence that the recurrent medical costs of meat eater higher\
no studies have been done specifically on medical spending vegan\
Non-vegans are 15% more likely to develop cancer, 40% more likely to develop heart disease, and over 100% more likely to develop diabetes than vegans. Some health insurance providers even offering lower rates for vegans. \
Recent studies are encouraging physicians to promote a plant-based lifestyle to help patients reduce medical costs. A national shift to less animal products could save billions in healthcare spending.\
