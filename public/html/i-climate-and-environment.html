                            Livestock and their byproducts account for approximately 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions, and those emissions are expected to increase by 80% by 2050. 
                            If we stopped all fossil fuel use today, we would still exceed our atmospheric greenhouse gas maximum of 32 gigatons in the next 12 years from livestock emissions alone. 
                            Animal agriculture is responsible for 80% of the worlds total deforestation which compounds the damage of the emissions.

                            We are currently in the middle of the largest mass extinction in 65 million years. 1/3 of all landmass is used for animal agriculture, 
                            and 1/3 is desertified with animal agriculture as the driving force. Animal agriculture is responsible for 91% of the deforestation of the Amazon for grazing animals and growing feed crops, 
                            with 1-2 acres being lost every second. Other industries (logging, farming, etc.) certainly play a role, however animal agriculture is destroying ecosystems at a rate that dwarfs all of these other industries combined.

                            Around 2.7 trillion animals are pulled out of the ocean every year. For every 1 pound of fish that are caught, 5 pounds of unintented marine species are discarded as by-kill. 
                            3/4 of the wolrds oceans are already depleted and we could see fishless oceans by as early as 2048. As many as 650 thousand dolphins and whales, 
                            and 40 - 50 million sharks are killed every year. 46% of the plastic in the ocean is from commercial fishing. 
                            Livestock operations on land have created more than 500 nitrogen flooded deadzones in around the ocean.<span class='dy-modal-link dy-modal'> (2) </a>
