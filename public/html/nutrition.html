                        Meat and other animal products tend to be high in saturated fats and dietary cholesterol which can contribute to higher rates of obesity 
                        and a higher risk of heart disease. In addition, meat and animal products often contain harsh chemical preservatives, antibiotics, carcinogens, 
                        and added hormones. Meat heavy diets are associated with a higher level of risk for developing cancer.
                        Other nutritional impacts of a meat-heavy diet include: weak hair & nails, yellowed teeth, acne, fatigue, bad breath & body odor, constipation, and decreased sexual performance.

                        Plant heavy diets naturally tend to have healthier macro ratios (fats/ carbs/ protein) as well as more vitamins and minerals that the body can easily absorb. Plants are high in fiber which
                        improves digestive health. Vegan and vegetarian diets have been shown to support a healthier gut microbiome which has far reaching health effects. The low calorie density of many plant-centric meals
                        helps with losing excess weight as one can eat more and feel more full, while consuming fewer calories.

                    <div class='dy-text'>In controlled randomized studies, those on vegan diets lost 
                        more weight than control groups on non-vegan diets. The reasons are simple. 
                        Vegan diets are naturally lower in calories and fat. Vegan foods being less calorie 
                        dense means that you can eat more and feel more full while consuming fewer calories.
                        Don't worry though, if you're trying to put on more muscle there are plenty of vegan options
                        out there to help you stack up those sweet gainz.
